# HTML & CSS Practice Tasks 🚀

This repository contains **11 small projects** built while revisiting **HTML & CSS from scratch**.
The goal of this task folder is simple: **strengthen fundamentals, improve layout thinking, and build confidence without relying on frameworks**.

Each project focuses on a specific concept or combination of concepts, gradually increasing in complexity.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Folder

* Practice **core HTML structure** and **semantic markup**
* Build layouts using **CSS Grid and Flexbox**
* Understand **responsive design** without hacks
* Write cleaner, more readable styles using **SCSS** (mixins, nesting, structure)
* Improve consistency in spacing, typography, and alignment
* Learn by building, breaking, and refining

No shortcuts. No frameworks. Just fundamentals.

## 🗂️ Projects Overview

This folder contains **11 basic projects**, each designed to isolate and practice a specific idea:

* Static page layouts
* Responsive sections and components
* Grid-based layouts (including bento-style structures)
* Flexbox for internal alignment
* Image handling and aspect-ratio control
* Typography and spacing systems
* Scroll-based animations (fade-in using Intersection Observer)
* SCSS-based styling for better code organization

Each project is kept intentionally simple so the **focus stays on layout logic and CSS behavior**, not visuals alone.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning Through These Tasks

* **Responsiveness as a system**, not trial-and-error media queries
* When to use **Grid vs Flexbox** (page structure vs component alignment)
* How **grid-template-areas** help switch layouts cleanly across breakpoints
* Writing reusable styles using **SCSS mixins**
* Keeping code readable and scalable even for small projects
* Thinking in terms of structure before styling

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* HTML5
* CSS3
* SCSS (mixins, nesting, better structure)
* Vanilla JavaScript (only where needed, e.g. scroll animations)

No Bootstrap. No Tailwind. No libraries.

## 📈 Progress Philosophy

These projects are not meant to be perfect.
They are meant to be **honest practice**.

Each task builds confidence, reinforces basics, and prepares me for more complex frontend work later.

---

## ✅ Status

* ✔️ 11 projects completed
* 🔄 Still refining responsiveness and interactions
* 📚 Actively revisiting concepts and improving code quality

If you’re learning frontend fundamentals, this folder reflects what **real practice** looks like — slow, deliberate, and hands-on.
